# ArcGIS Javascript API 4.18+ and Angular 11 problem

This code is based on the following sample, but slightly modified to use another feature service and adding the editor widget.

## The problem
The problem is that when adding a feature or graphic to a map, the symbol won't show until zooming in or out.
